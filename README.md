## 🧠 How It Works

- The user selects their *district, **mandal, and **village*.
- A *water level simulator* (slider) mimics input from a water level sensor.
- As the level increases:
  - The *gauge fill* updates visually.
  - *Alerts* are triggered depending on danger thresholds.
  - *Sound notifications* play to warn users.
- The app suggests *safe nearby shelters* during high water alerts.
